# Docker_AF3Complex
 docker image for AF3Complex program. This docker image is for AF3Complex, an improved structural predictions of protein complexes based on AlphaFold3. Acknowledgement should be given to https://github.com/Jfeldman34/AF3Complex‚Å† .

 I have built a docker image for AF3Complex, you can use it from: `docker pull chongjing518/af3complex:af3`, or build singularity image from my docker image.

## Step1: Clone AF3Complex repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Jfeldman34/AF3Complex.git

#please note there are several errors in original run_af3complex.py and run_intermediate.py
#I modified it, then used modified file for docker image
```

## Step2: Make a dockerfile
```dockerfile

# Some RUN statements are combined together to make Docker build run faster.
# Get latest package listing, install software-properties-common, git, wget,
# compilers and libraries.
# git is required for pyproject.toml toolchain's use of CMakeLists.txt.
# gcc, g++, make are required for compiling hmmer and AlphaFold 3 libaries.
# zlib is a required dependency of AlphaFold 3.
RUN apt update --quiet \
    && apt install --yes --quiet software-properties-common \
    && apt install --yes --quiet git wget gcc g++ make zlib1g-dev zstd

# Get apt repository of specific Python versions. Then install Python. Tell APT
# this isn't an interactive TTY to avoid timezone prompt when installing.
RUN add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa \

# Update pip to the latest version. Not necessary in Docker, but good to do when
# this is used as a recipe for local installation since we rely on new pip
# features for secure installs.
RUN pip3 install --upgrade pip

# Install HMMER. Do so before copying the source code, so that docker can cache
# the image layer containing HMMER. Alternatively, you could also install it
# using `apt-get install hmmer` instead of bulding it from source.
RUN mkdir /hmmer_build /hmmer ; \

# Copy the AF3Complex source code from the local machine to the container and
# set the working directory to there.
COPY ./AF3Complex /app/AF3Complex

# Install the Python dependencies AlphaFold 3 needs.
RUN pip3 install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# To work around a known XLA issue causing the compilation time to greatly
# increase, the following environment variable setting XLA flags must be enabled
# when running AlphaFold 3. Note that if using CUDA capability 7 GPUs, it is
# necessary to set the following XLA_FLAGS value instead:
# ENV XLA_FLAGS="--xla_disable_hlo_passes=custom-kernel-fusion-rewriter"
# (no need to disable gemm in that case as it is not supported for such GPU).
ENV XLA_FLAGS="--xla_gpu_enable_triton_gemm=false"
# Memory settings used for folding up to 5,120 tokens on A100 80 GB.
ENV XLA_PYTHON_CLIENT_PREALLOCATE=true
ENV XLA_CLIENT_MEM_FRACTION=0.95

CMD ["python3", "/app/AF3Complex/run_alphafold.py"]
```

## Step 3: Build the Docker Image for AF3Complex
```bash
# run this in the parental directory that contains ./AF3Complex subdirectory and the Dockerfile
docker build -t af3complex:af3 .
```

## Step 4: Push Docker Image to Docker Hub
```bash
docker login
docker tag af3complex chongjing518/af3complex:af3
docker push chongjing518/af3complex:af3
```

## Step 5: Build Singularity Image from af3complex docker image
```bash
singularity build af3complex.sif docker://chongjing518/af3complex:af3
```
